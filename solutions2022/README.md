# Day 1: Calorie Counting #

## Part 1 ##

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on
Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves
have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. Although
the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in
case.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second
puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition
traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One
important consideration is food - in particular, the number of **Calories** each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).

The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that
they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (
if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:

- The first Elf is carrying food with ```1000```, ```2000```, and ```3000``` Calories, a total of ```6000``` Calories.
- The second Elf is carrying one food item with ```4000``` Calories.
- The third Elf is carrying food with ```5000``` and ```6000``` Calories, a total of ```11000``` Calories.
- The fourth Elf is carrying food with ```7000```, ```8000```, and ```9000``` Calories, a total of ```24000``` Calories.
- The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with ```10000``` Calories.

In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many
Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the **most** Calories. In the example above, this is ```24000``` (carried
by the fourth Elf).

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. **How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?**

## Part 2 ##

By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already realized that the Elf carrying the most
Calories of food might eventually **run out of snacks.**

To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the **top three
** Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two
backups.

In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with ```24000``` Calories), then the third Elf (
with ```11000``` Calories), then the fifth Elf (with ```10000``` Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these
three elves is ```45000```.

Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. **How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?**

# Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone #

## Part 1 ##

You feel the ground rumble again as the distress signal leads you to a large network of subterranean tunnels. You don't
have time to search them all, but you don't need to: your pack contains a set of deployable sensors that you imagine
were originally built to locate lost Elves.

The sensors aren't very powerful, but that's okay; your handheld device indicates that you're close enough to the source
of the distress signal to use them. You pull the emergency sensor system out of your pack, hit the big button on top,
and the sensors zoom off down the tunnels.

Once a sensor finds a spot it thinks will give it a good reading, it attaches itself to a hard surface and begins
monitoring for the nearest signal source **beacon**. Sensors and beacons always exist at integer coordinates. Each
sensor knows its own position and can **determine the position of a beacon precisely**; however, sensors can only lock
on to the one beacon **closest to the sensor** as measured by the Manhattan distance. (There is never a tie where two
beacons are the same distance to a sensor.)

It doesn't take long for the sensors to report back their positions and closest beacons (your puzzle input). For
example:

```
Sensor at x=2, y=18: closest beacon is at x=-2, y=15
Sensor at x=9, y=16: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
Sensor at x=13, y=2: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
Sensor at x=12, y=14: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
Sensor at x=10, y=20: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
Sensor at x=14, y=17: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
Sensor at x=8, y=7: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
Sensor at x=2, y=0: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
Sensor at x=0, y=11: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
Sensor at x=20, y=14: closest beacon is at x=25, y=17
Sensor at x=17, y=20: closest beacon is at x=21, y=22
Sensor at x=16, y=7: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
Sensor at x=14, y=3: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
Sensor at x=20, y=1: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
```

So, consider the sensor at ```2,18```; the closest beacon to it is at ```-2,15```. For the sensor at ```9,16```, the
closest beacon to it
is at ```10,16```.

Drawing sensors as S and beacons as B, the above arrangement of sensors and beacons looks like this:

```
               1    1    2    2
     0    5    0    5    0    5
00 ....S.......................
01 ......................S.....
02 ...............S............
03 ................SB..........
04 ............................
05 ............................
06 ............................
07 ..........S.......S.........
08 ............................
09 ............................
10 ....B.......................
11 ..S.........................
12 ............................
13 ............................
14 ..............S.......S.....

17 ................S..........B
18 ....S.......................
19 ............................
20 ............S......S........
21 ............................
22 .......................B....
```

This isn't necessarily a comprehensive map of all beacons in the area, though. Because each sensor only identifies its
closest beacon, if a sensor detects a beacon, you know there are no other beacons that close or closer to that sensor.
There could still be beacons that just happen to not be the closest beacon to any sensor. Consider the sensor
at ```8,7```:

```
               1    1    2    2
     0    5    0    5    0    5
-2 ..........#.................
-1 .........###................
00 ....S...#####...............
01 .......#######........S.....
02 ......#########S............

17 ................S..........B
18 ....S.......................
19 ............................
20 ............S......S........
21 ............................
22 .......................B....
```

This sensor's closest beacon is at ```2,10```, and so you know there are no beacons that close or closer (in any
positions
marked ```#```).

None of the detected beacons seem to be producing the distress signal, so you'll need to work out where the distress
beacon is by working out where it **isn't**. For now, keep things simple by counting the positions where a beacon cannot
possibly be along just a single row.

So, suppose you have an arrangement of beacons and sensors like in the example above and, just in the row
where ```y=10```,
you'd like to count the number of positions a beacon cannot possibly exist. The coverage from all sensors near that row
looks like this:

```
                 1    1    2    2
       0    5    0    5    0    5
09 ...#########################...
10 ..####B######################..
11 .###S#############.###########.
```

In this example, in the row where ```y=10```, there are ```26``` positions where a beacon cannot be present.

Consult the report from the sensors you just deployed. **In the row where ```y=2000000```, how many positions cannot
contain a
beacon?**

## Part 2 ##

Your handheld device indicates that the distress signal is coming from a beacon nearby. The distress beacon is not
detected by any sensor, but the distress beacon must have ```x``` and ```y``` coordinates each no lower than ```0``` and
no larger than
```4000000```.

To isolate the distress beacon's signal, you need to determine its **tuning frequency**, which can be found by
multiplying its ```x``` coordinate by ```4000000``` and then adding its y coordinate.

In the example above, the search space is smaller: instead, the x and y coordinates can each be at most ```20```. With
this
reduced search area, there is only a single position that could have a beacon: ```x=14```, ```y=11```. The tuning
frequency for this
distress beacon is ```56000011```.

Find the only possible position for the distress beacon. **What is its tuning frequency?**
